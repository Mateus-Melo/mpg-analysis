# README

This is a data science project that made use of a dataset containing information about cars. In this project, I have investigated the influence of manual and automatic transmission in the mpg (miles per gallon of the cars) and made use of tools like R (ggplot2, gridExtra, GGally), RStudio, RMarkdown, statistical inference, regression models, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/mpg-analysis/).
